# PassWord_Gene
Password Generator

# Installation
- No install needed! Just load up the web page!

# Usage
- Once you load the page, click the red "Generate Password". A pop-up will come up, asking how many characters you'd like to include in your password. Enter any number between or including 8-128. After an acceptable number of characters is entered, the page will ask you which types of characters you might like to use in your password. The options for character types are: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers 0-9, and/or special characters including, but not limited to, "! @ #". If you don't select any character types, the process is ended and you'll have to restart from the beginning. Otherwise a new, randomly generated, password will appear in the browser page!
